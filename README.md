# S&P 500 Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

  ## Introduction

  This project aims to predict the direction of the S&P 500 stock index using machine learning techniques. The S&P 500 is a widely followed index that tracks the performance of 500 large-cap American stocks. By predicting its movement, this    project offers insights valuable for investors and traders.

  ## Project Overview

  StockPricePrediction.py: Python file containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

  ## Dependencies

  Python 3
  yfinance for retrieving historical S&P 500 data.
  pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
  matplotlib for data visualization.
  scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models.

  ## Results

  The model achieves a precision score of 0.6 (60%) on the test data with no leakage.
  Backtesting the model on historical data yields a precision score of 0.57 (57%) with no leakage. Performs great for real-world usage.
